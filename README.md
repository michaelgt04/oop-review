# OOP Review Clinic

## Instructions

This is the code from my Object Oriented Programming review this week! This should look fairly
similar to the assignments you've been doing thus far at Launch. There are `rspec` tests written
for you already, you just need to get them to pass!

A few helpful things to remember:

* Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle
	
	The more you can make sure you adhere to this rule, the more readable and easy to understand 
	it will be. Remember that one of the huge advantges of the OOP paradigm
	is that if used correctly, it can make our code enormously more readable and thus easier
	to reason about as it gets more complex.

	You may be tempted to stop once you get the tests passing, but don't forget the crucial last
	step of refactoring your code where you can!

* Look at your test files!

	There may be hints about implementation or more specific instructions if you look at the test
	files! It's not cheating to do that, the test files are your friend!

* Pry
	
	The sooner you get comfortable with your debugging tools, the better. They will make you a far
	more productive and successful programmer. The sooner you get comfortable using them, the
	easier it will be to use them when our code gets more complex. If it's not working, throw a pry
	in it!
